# Contracts Notes

This batch has no new public API/schema contract additions. It is a low-risk
upstream absorption verification batch.

- No new tool/function schema fields introduced.
- No backward-incompatible contract changes.
- Any equivalent behavior already present in `easy` is retained as-is.
