- [x] Mandatory sections complete

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] Functional requirements map to executable validation tasks
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Verification evidence recorded after command execution

## Notes

- `rg -n "client_args" src tests docs examples` -> `NO_MATCH`.
- `./.venv/bin/python -m ruff check src tests docs examples` reports
  pre-existing tutorial lint issues not introduced by this feature.
- Scoped Ruff checks across touched files pass.
- `./.venv/bin/python -m pylint -E src` passes.
- `pytest` exits abnormally in this local environment; focused model tests were
  executed via unittest and passed: 24 tests, 0 failures.
